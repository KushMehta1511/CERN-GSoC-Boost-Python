How SWIG can be implemented in CMSSW?  

Let us consider the [PayoadInspector](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/ba6e8604a35283e39e89bc031766843d0afc3240/CondCore/Utilities/src/PayloadInspector.cc) file. Here there are several functions which implement Boost::Python like "PlotBase::setInputParamsValues". So to implement python to such functions using SWIG we have to create an Intefrace file as described in the [sorting.i](https://github.com/KushMehta1511/CERN-GSoC-Boost-Python/blob/main/sorting.i) file. We would have to create the function/file template in C++ and create an extra interface file for each original file containing the desired functions and thereby generating a wrapper file.   
Individual functions as well as entire files can be wrapped using SWIG through the interface file and allows to make necessary changes in them. Given the flexibility in choosing appropriate function and allowing to use desired python IDE for the programmer, I believe this alternative approach could help in achieving our goal.
